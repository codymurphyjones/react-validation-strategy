# Aspirations of React Validation Strategy

This document exists as a point of reference for the long term discussions around react-validation-strategy, this is a living document for expressing ideas and the views expressed here may not directly correlate to the current state of the ecosystem.

> "The most reusable componetns are those with class names that are independent of the content"

#### Planned Changes:
- **`createStateSlice`**: Create the data types needed for managing the reducer object created from a validation input
- **`validate`**: Configures the validation types for a state slice
- **`validationMethod`**`: Enable more granular control from the sync function by providing a system describing when a field should be validated.-
- **`optional`**: makes it so that a field is not required for a successful validation call.
- **`parse`**: Enables support for custom validators to parse the state.
- **`submit`**: checks to see if all validation states are passing, executes submit call.
- **`messages`**: Display validation messages if a validation fails

## The `createStateSlice` Function
The `createStateSlice` function plays a key role in `react-validation-strategy` and aims to enhance type safety in validation systems. This function enables a clear separation of the state and input definitions from the validation definitions. This enhances the maintainability and scalability of your code by segregating concerns, keeping your validation logic separate from your state management.

In its simplest form, the createStateSlice function receives an object representing your state. Each key-value pair in this object represents a field in your state. The keys are your field names and the values are objects specifying the properties of the fields.

Here is an example of how you can use `createStateSlice`:

```ts
const val = Validation.createStateSlice({
  fieldName: {
    value: '', // Default value
    type: 'text', // Input type
    placeholder: 'Enter your first name', // Placeholder
    settings: {
      defaultStyle: {
		border: "thick double rgba(0,0,0,0)"
	  }, // Default CSS styles
      errorStyle: {
		border: "thick double red"
	  },
    },
    accessibility: {
      ariaLabel: 'First Name', // Accessibility labels
      tabIndex: 0, // Tab index for better accessibility navigation
    }
  },
  // Additional fields go here...
})
```


### StateSlice

In the above example, firstName is a field with several properties. Let's breakdown these properties:

First let's take a look at `fieldName`, which will be the label and access key for any data created or updated using that key.  The `StateSlice` object can be passed any key that you like, and you configure it with the settings below.

However, in order to provide a more streamlined configuration for plugging into input forms, there is a key value that can be passed into the `StateSlice` object that will propogate across all of the configurations currently defined, assuming that the values are not overridden directly on the key definition.  The unique key that accomplishes this is called `defaultForm`

#### `defaultForm` Interactions

As the name indicates, the defaultForm field is intended to help streamline the process of input parameter generation.  Of course we could manually define each field if we wanted or needed to but react-validation-strategy strives to simplify your entire input management workload.  

It does this by pretending to be a regular `StateSlice` type with the exception that it doesn't support the defaut value parameter.  Once the data structure is passed into the useValidation call

#### StateSlice Type
| key | type | description  | Required
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |---------------|
| `value` | any | The default value of the field. | Yes |
| `type` | string | The type of input, e.g. 'text', 'number', etc. | No |
| `placeholder` | string | Placeholder text displayed in the input field. | No |
| `settings` | object | Contains style-related settings. | No |
| `accessibility` | object | Contains accessibility-related attributes. | No |


#### The `settings`` object can have the following keys:


Key |	Type |	Description	| Required
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |---------------|
| `defaultStyle`	| Any	| The default value of the field. |	Yes
| `errorStyle` | String |	The type of input, e.g. 'text', 'number', etc.|	No


#####  The `accessibility` object can have the following keys:

Key |	Type |	Description	| Required
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |---------------|
| `ariaLabel`	| Any	| The default value of the field. |	Yes
| `tabIndex`	| String |	The type of input, e.g. 'text', 'number', etc.|	No

Remember, all keys except 'value' are optional. If you only need to set a default value for a field without specifying other properties, you can simply do this:

```ts
const val = Validation.createStateSlice({
  firstName: '',
  // Additional fields go here...
})
```


In this case, `firstName` will be a field with an empty string as its default value.

}
```

## The `validate` function
With the introduction of the new state systen and its configurations for direct integrations with inputs we had to extract the validation step into its own statement as well.  Fortunately there are some very significant strengths from this move such as enabling custom validations to be state aware.

With this change, we also hope to introduce utilities for first class zod support, state manipulation and update blocking.  Unfortunately, I know absolutely nothing about the obstacles that I'm going to face during that implementation and I cannot comment on the strategy that will be used.  The most important objective is first class zod support, state manipulation and update blocking may even need to be sacricied in favor of zod support.


```ts
const UserValidation = Validation.createStateSlice({
  firstName: "",
  lastName: "",
  username: "",
  displayName: "",
  password: "",
  confirmPassword: "",
  button: "",
  email: "",
}).validate({
  firstName: Validation.new("")
    .length(2, 20)
    .match(/^[A-z]*$/)
    .blocking(),
  lastName: Validation.new("")
    .length(2, 20)
    .match(/^[A-z]*$/)
    .blocking(),
  username: Validation.new("").length(5, 10).not(),
  displayName: Validation.new("").length(2, 200).includes("@").blocking(),
  password: Validation.new("").match(reg),
  confirmPassword: Validation.new("").custom((val) => val.length > 5),
  button: Validation.new(""),
  email: Validation.new("").parse(z.string().email("This must be an email")).length(2, 200).includes("@"),
});

```


Hook usage
```ts

export default function UserForm() {
  const [syncInput, isValid] = useValidation(UserValidation);

  return (
    <form>

        {...syncInput(
          "firstName",
          {
            border: "thick double rgba(0,0,0,0)",
          },
          {
            border: "thick double red",
          }
        )}
      />
      <input
        {...syncInput(
          "lastName",
          {
            border: "thick double rgba(0,0,0,0)",
          },
          {
            border: "thick double red",
          }
        )}
      />

"KeystoneArch": In architecture, a keystone is the wedge-shaped stone piece at the apex of a masonry arch. It is the final piece placed during construction and locks all the stones into position, allowing the arch to bear weight. This could represent the crucial role your library plays in holding together the structure and behavior of the components.

Shared Task Management: The application should allow users to create, assign, and manage tasks both for personal goals and for home chores. This would include due dates, reminders, and progress tracking.

Collaboration Features: The ability to share tasks, goals, and chores with others is crucial. This could include live updates, comments, and the ability to assign tasks to others.

Integration with Calendars: The application should integrate with popular calendar applications to allow users to schedule their tasks and chores, and to see their personal and shared schedules in one place.

Goal Setting and Tracking: The application should allow users to set personal goals, break them down into tasks, and track their progress towards these goals.

Home Management Features: This could include features specific to managing a home, such as a shared shopping list, meal planning, and maintenance reminders.

User-Friendly Interface: The application should be easy to use and visually appealing, with a clear and intuitive layout.

Customizability: Users should be able to customize the application to fit their specific needs, such as creating custom categories for tasks and goals, or setting custom reminders.

Privacy Settings: Since the application would be used for both personal and shared tasks, it should have robust privacy settings to allow users to control who can see and edit their tasks and goals.

Notifications and Reminders: The application should have a system for sending reminders and notifications, to help users stay on top of their tasks and goals.

Cross-Platform Availability: The application should be available on multiple platforms (web, iOS, Android) to allow users to access it from any device.


Creating a solution that captures the niche between personal goal/task management and home chore management would require a careful consideration of the needs and pain points of the target users. Here are some key features and considerations that could help in capturing this niche: By incorporating these features and considerations, a solution could effectively capture the niche between personal goal/task management and home chore management.

_______________________


Dashboard/Home Screen: This would be the first screen you see when you open the app. It would provide an overview of your day and the tasks at hand.

Task Overview: This section would show your tasks for the day, divided into personal tasks and shared tasks (like chores). You could tap on a task to edit it or mark it as complete.

Calendar Integration: Below or beside the tasks, you'd see your calendar events for the day. This would integrate with your existing calendar app(s) to show both personal and shared events.

Goal Progress: This section would show your progress towards your personal goals. It could display a progress bar or a percentage for each goal.

Notifications: Any reminders or notifications would appear at the top of the screen, so you can see them right away.

Task Detail Screen: When you tap on a task in the Dashboard, you'd be taken to a detailed view of that task.

Task Details: This would show the name of the task, the due date, any notes you've added, and the status of the task (not started, in progress, completed).

Subtasks: If the task has been broken down into smaller tasks, those would be listed here. You could mark each subtask as complete individually.

Comments/Communication: If the task is shared, there would be a section for comments or communication about the task. You could leave a note for your partner or family members, and they could respond.

Attachments: If there are any relevant attachments for the task (like a shopping list for a grocery shopping task), they would be accessible here.

These two screens would provide a comprehensive view of your daily tasks and progress towards your goals, making it easier to manage your personal tasks and coordinate with your family.

Absolutely, let's imagine a screen that adds an element of fun and engagement to the app, making it a joy to use every day. We'll call this the "Family Engagement Screen".

Family Engagement Screen: This screen is designed to foster a sense of community, fun, and friendly competition within the family or household.

Achievement Badges: Users can earn badges for completing tasks, achieving personal goals, or contributing to shared chores. These badges would be displayed prominently on this screen, serving as a visual representation of each user's accomplishments.

Leaderboard: There could be a leaderboard showing who has completed the most tasks or earned the most badges in a certain time period. This friendly competition could motivate users to stay engaged with their tasks and goals.

Family/Group Chat: A chat feature would allow users to communicate, coordinate, and celebrate achievements together. This could include text, photos, and even fun stickers or emojis.

Shared Photo Album: Users could share photos related to their tasks or just fun moments from their day. For example, a photo of a completed chore, a picture of a meal cooked from a planned recipe, or a snapshot of a family member achieving a personal goal.

Fun Challenges: The app could generate fun, optional challenges for the family to complete together. For example, "Complete 20 chores as a family this week" or "Everyone achieve one personal goal this month". Completing these challenges could earn special badges or rewards.

Personalized Avatars: Each user could create a fun, personalized avatar that represents them on this screen. The avatars could even level up or gain new accessories as users complete tasks and achieve goals.

This Family Engagement Screen would not only make the app more enjoyable to use, but also foster a sense of community and shared achievement within the family or household. It would provide a daily dose of fun and motivation, making users want to open the app every day.


Sure, let's imagine a screen that combines home maintenance with personal development. We'll call this the "Personal Growth and Home Maintenance Screen".

Personal Growth and Home Maintenance Screen: This screen is designed to inspire users to become the best version of themselves while also maintaining a clean and organized home.

Personal Growth Goals: This section would allow users to set and track personal growth goals. These could be anything from "Read 20 minutes a day" to "Practice mindfulness twice a week". Each goal would have a progress bar and a log for tracking completed sessions.

Home Maintenance Tasks: This section would list tasks related to home maintenance, such as cleaning, repairs, or gardening. Users could set a schedule for these tasks and mark them as complete when done.

Inspiration and Motivation: This section would provide daily motivational quotes, tips for personal growth, and suggestions for home maintenance tasks. It could also include a feature for users to add their own motivational content or personal affirmations.

Habit Tracker: This feature would allow users to track their daily habits related to personal growth and home maintenance. They could see their streaks for each habit and get reminders to keep up with their habits.

Reflection Journal: At the end of each day, users could be prompted to reflect on their progress towards their personal growth goals and home maintenance tasks. They could write a short journal entry, which would be saved and could be reviewed later.

Resources: This section could provide resources for personal growth and home maintenance, such as articles, videos, or recommended books.

This Personal Growth and Home Maintenance Screen would not only help users keep their home clean and organized, but also inspire them to work towards becoming the person they've always wanted to be. It would provide a daily reminder of their goals and the steps they're taking to achieve them.


Certainly, the settings or private section of the app is crucial as it allows users to customize their experience and control their privacy. Here's how it could be designed to best satisfy users:

Profile Settings: This would allow users to manage their personal details, such as name, email, profile picture, and password. They could also manage their personalized avatar here.

Privacy Settings: Users should be able to control who can see their tasks, goals, and progress. They could choose to share certain tasks or goals with specific people, or keep them private. They could also control who can see their posts on the Family Engagement Screen.

Notification Settings: Users could customize their notifications here. They could choose which types of notifications they want to receive, and how they want to receive them (push notifications, emails, etc.). They could also set quiet hours when they won't receive any notifications.

Integration Settings: This is where users could connect the app to their calendar, email, or other apps. They could control which apps are connected and what information is shared between them.

Customization Settings: Users could customize the look and feel of the app here. They could choose a color scheme, decide which sections appear on their Dashboard, and arrange the order of sections to their liking.

Help & Support: This section would provide resources to help users get the most out of the app. It could include a FAQ, tutorials, and a way to contact customer support.

Feedback & Suggestions: Users could provide feedback and suggestions to improve the app. This is a great way to make users feel heard and to gather ideas for future updates.

In terms of building the settings experience, it's important to make it as user-friendly as possible. The settings should be clearly labeled and organized in a logical way. It could be helpful to include a search function so users can quickly find the setting they're looking for. Also, for more complex settings, consider providing a brief explanation or a link to a help article.

Remember, the goal of the settings is to give users control over their experience with the app. So, it's important to listen to user feedback and be willing to make changes based on their needs and preferences.

Warm colors like orange and yellow could be used for tasks and goals, to evoke feelings of energy and motivation. Cool colors like blue and green could be used for the home and family sections, to evoke feelings of calm and harmony. The overall tone of the app should be positive and encouraging, with friendly, supportive language.

Improving the Negatives:

To avoid overwhelming users with too much information on the Dashboard, consider using collapsible sections or a tabbed interface. This would allow users to see a summary of each section and expand it for more details.
To make the Task Detail screen easier to use, ensure that the editing features are intuitive and that help is readily available. Consider using tooltips or a quick tutorial to guide users through the process.
To ensure that the Family Engagement features don't feel gimmicky, involve users in the design process. Gather feedback on these features and make improvements based on user suggestions.
To make the Personal Growth and Home Maintenance screen more engaging, allow users to customize their personal growth goals and home maintenance tasks. This could include allowing users to set their own goals, choose from a list of suggested tasks, or adjust the frequency of tasks.
To make the Settings screen more user-friendly, organize the settings in a logical way and provide a search function. For more complex settings, provide a brief explanation or a link to a help article.

Brand Story:

Hi there, I'm Cody. I want to share a story with you, a story that's deeply personal and one that has led to the creation of something I'm incredibly proud of.

You see, I have ADHD. It's a part of who I am, and it's shaped my life in many ways. It's given me a unique perspective on the world, but it's also presented me with some unique challenges, especially when it comes to managing daily tasks and personal goals.

In the midst of the hustle and bustle of everyday life, I found myself struggling to keep up with personal tasks, home chores, and personal growth goals. I knew I wasn't alone in this struggle. There were others out there, each with their unique strengths and challenges, who were also looking for a better way to manage their lives.

So, I decided to create a solution - ChoreCircle. The goal was simple yet ambitious: to create a tool that could help individuals like me, and families too, manage their tasks and chores while also fostering personal growth and community. The challenge was to design an app that was not only functional but also engaging, supportive, and fun to use.

ChoreCircle was born out of this challenge. It's designed with features that allow users to manage their tasks, set and track personal goals, and collaborate with others. But it doesn't stop there. ChoreCircle also adds elements of fun and community, with achievement badges, a leaderboard, and a shared photo album. It's more than just a task manager - it's a tool for improving life and fostering a sense of community.

Today, ChoreCircle continues to evolve, driven by the feedback and needs of its users. Our mission is to make managing life a joy, not a chore. I believe that everyone, regardless of their challenges, has the potential to achieve their goals and live a fulfilling life. And I'm here to support you every step of the way.

Can you give me a matching description the other colors as well?

After that can you describe in vivid crystal clear detail how you would make the Dashboard/Home screen of ChoreCircle if you had to design it.  

Here is a react structure to show how the Home screen would be built.  Can you describe what you would do, and then add css to (and html if you know how to replace it with  my psuedonames)

For the sake of this diagram, assume I have 2 events on my calendar today, and thats why Calendar is built that way.

```ts
<App>
	<GoalProgress />
	<CalendarItems>
		<CalendarItem />
		<CalendarItem />
	</CalendarItems>
	<TaskList />
	<Notifications />
	<TaskModal>
		<Task>
			<TDetails />
			<Subtasks />
			<Subtasks />
	        <Attachments />
		</Task>
	</TaskModal>
</App>
```

const UserSignUp = UserSignIn.mergeStates(UserPreferences, UserPreferences2);



Argument of type 'StateSlice<unknown, { firstName: string; lastName: string; confirmPassword: string; }>' is not assignable to parameter of type 'StateSlice<unknown, { displayName: string; email: string; }>'.
  Type '{ firstName: string; lastName: string; confirmPassword: string; }' is missing the following properties from type '{ displayName: string; email: string; }': displayName, emailts(2345)
const UserPreferences2: StateSlice<unknown, {
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
    confirmPassword: string;
}>

{ firstName: string; lastName: string; confirmPassword: string; } is not assignable to parameter of type { displayName: string; email: string; }

It's basically telling me that UserPrefernces2 isnt the exact same as UserPreferences and therefore an error.

Is there anyway for me to dynamicly type ...rest  parameters without losing typesaftey or throwing an error?
